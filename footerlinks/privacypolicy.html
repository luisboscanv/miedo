                SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
                
                Our website and Apps have appropriate security measures in place to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers. We have also put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach.
                
                Where you have chosen a password which enables you to access certain parts of our website or our Apps, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you to choose an effective, secure password and not to share your password with anyone.
                
                We recommend only connecting to secure wireless networks that you trust to reduce the risk of unauthorised people intercepting your online activity. Beware of the risks of using public wifi.
                
                If you receive an email purporting to be from Keychron asking for personal data, please do not respond to the email but please let us know that this has happened so we can check whether the email is genuine.
                
                 
                
                OUTSIDE EEA - DATA STORAGE & TRANSFER
                
                The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to work with members of the Keychron and third parties who we use to help us carry out the purposes referred to above or to comply with a legal duty.
                
                Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we will make sure an adequate level of protection is afforded to it by using one of the following safeguards:
                
                We may transfer your personal data to countries that have privacy laws which give the same level of protection for personal data as the EEA;
                
                We may use contract clauses with recipients which mean they must protect your personal data with the same level of protection as it has in the EEA;
                
                We may transfer personal data to organization if they are part of the Privacy Shield framework which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between European countries and the US.
                
                 
                
                HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA
                
                We will keep your data for as long as you are a customer and thereafter we may keep it for longer in order to respond to any questions or complaints and to maintain necessary records to satisfy legal, accounting or reporting requirements. We may also keep your data for research or statistical purposes.
                
                 
                
                YOUR RIGHTS
                
                You have the right to object to our use of your personal information, or to ask us to delete, remove or stop using it if there is no need for us to keep it. Please let us know if you think we should not be using it, but please be aware that there may be legal or other official reasons why we need to keep or use your information.
                
                Your rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data are briefly summarised below, and you can exercise these rights by emailing us at support@keychron.com.
                
                Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
                
                Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
                
                Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. Please note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which we will tell you about, if applicable, after receiving your request.
                
                Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
                
                Request restriction of processing of your personal data. You can ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; © where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
                
                Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Please note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
                
                Withdraw consent at any time if we are relying on your consent to process your personal data (such as direct marketing and cookies). This won’t affect any processing already carried out before you withdraw your consent or processing under other grounds. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.
                
                We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
                
                You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data and we try to respond to all requests within one month.
                
                If you have any questions or require any more information please contact us at support@keychron.com</p>
